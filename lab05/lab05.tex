    \section{定时切换}
    Write an RYU controller that switches paths (h1-s1-s3-s2-h2 or h1-s1-s4-s2-h2) between h1 and h2 every 5 seconds. 

    

    \section{}
    Write an RYU controller that uses both paths to forward packets from h1 to h2.

    \section{}
    Write an RYU controller that uses the first path (h1-s1-s3-s2-h2) for routing packets from h1 to h2 and uses the second path for backup. Specifically, when the first path experiences a link failure, the network should automatically switch to the second path without causing packet drop. (hint: consider using \verb"OFPGT_FF" (FF is short for ``fast failover'') to construct a group table)
